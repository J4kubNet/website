Powered by Arkdep from the Arkane Linux project this exciting new Manjaro variant is available for public testing right now!

The goal of this release is to gather community feedback on the technology powering Manjaro Immutable.

Note that this is only an experimental release and not representative of the final version. There is also no support guarantee yet for this early testing version, so hold off on installing it as your primary operating system for now.
